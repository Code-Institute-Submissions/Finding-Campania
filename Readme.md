This site was designed by me to answer all the questions of people who ask me: where are you from? What can I do coming to your side? I imagined a gallery of all the most beautiful places to see and what to do in the area I come from. It is a magnifying glass on my territory often seen as sun, pizza and Camorra.

The site will focus on images, and on their interactivity that will lead us to discover the places we can visit with their description and a map that will show us how to reach them.

For now, there will be only an English version of the site and the connection to the various social networks will be fictitious, as there are no real contacts, and to improve it in the future replace the Hero image with a video in order to increase the visit time of the Home page.

The business goals of this website are:

* Build brand awareness.

* Collaborate with Hotels, B&Bs, museums, tourist guides,  etc...

* To be able to offer discounts and special rates to those who book through the site.

* Earn money with advertising or subscription services for companies that want to collaborate and not ask for commissions for each purchase made by visitors.

  

## UX

**Visitors to this website are searching for:**

* Having all the beautiful places in Campania in one site.
* Have a preview of all the places want to visit.
* Have the ability to see the location on the map of places.
* An intuitive and easy to navigate interface.

**Companies visiting this website searching for:**

* A professional website that offers them visibility.
* a website that gives him the opportunity to acquire new customers with offers without commissions.



## Strategy

My goal in design is to make everything as intuitive as possible with the interactivity of the images making the UX simple and fun.



## Scope

I would like to provide the possibility for users who want to visit Campania to be able to create an itinerary by themselves without wasting time in the different types of travel sites that show you offers on offers for places that are very distant from each other.

A user who chooses to visit this region in a targeted manner or who lives there for short periods has all the places that he can visit near him available.



## Structure

In the Home, there is a link with the three categories, which I identified based on what people are looking for. Further down there is an image of the region, and by clicking on one of the provinces you are directed to the Gallery, which will show the cards of the places ordered by province, to allow a more targeted search based on the province you want to visit.

The three categories identified are:

* Adventures in which there are cards representing the places where you can make excursions and playful activities,
* Art & Culture where there are cards representing museums, castles and places of art,
* Beaches where there are cards with all the most beautiful beaches.

The About page is where there will be a description of the Campania region and a description of myself with my photos that I visit some of these places.

The gallery contains all the cards of the various categories but ordered by the province to which you are directed by clicking on the name of the district on the Home page.

 In Contact, there is a simple form where visitors can ask for advice or send me requests for collaboration.

## Surface

I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to choose a color palette to use with a dark green base (for me as a boy scout it's the color of  the adventure).

## Technologies used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. BootstrapCDN
   - The project uses **Bootstrap4** to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive easily.
   - The project also uses BootstrapCDN to provide icons from [FontAwesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/).
4. Animate.css

   - The project uses Animate.css to animate the hero image.
5. Google Fonts
   - The project uses **Google fonts** to style the website fonts.

6. Visual Studio Code
 
7. GitPod

## Features

Each page features a responsive navigation bar with the title of website and a simple logo. Each page has a footer with copyright information and social media icons linking to home page of the respective media.

To create Responsive CSS Cards with Hover Animation I found suitable for what I had thought [here](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/2020/05/responsive-css-profile-cards-design.html).

## Features left to Implement

In the future, I would like:

* to add the links to the right social networks, because now the pages of the various social networks do not yet exist,
* add every places to visit because I selected just a few places for each category
* to replace the hero image with a video presentation,
* add another form for the business visitors,
* option to choose the language of the website.

## Testing

- [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
  - The developer used **W3C CSS Validation Service** and **W3C Markup Validation Service** to check the validity of the website code.
